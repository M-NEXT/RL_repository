## What is Deep Reinforcement Learning
1. Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) is a subfield of machine learning that combines reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning. 
2. RL considers the problem of a computational agent learning to make decisions by trial and error. 
3. Deep RL incorporates deep learning into the solution, allowing agents to make decisions from unstructured input data without manual engineering of the state space. 
4. Deep RL algorithms are able to take in very large inputs (e.g. every pixel rendered to the screen in a video game) and decide what actions to perform to optimize an objective (eg. maximizing the game score).
