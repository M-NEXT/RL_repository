# Deep Q learning with input as raw images of environment
## Overview
This is a simple PyTorch implementation of DQN using raw images as inputs. This repo is solely for my own practice and not for reproducing the same result as given in original paper.

## Dependencies
* Python
* PyTorch
* OpenAI Gym
* Atari-py environments (optional)

## Run
**Algorithm tested on [CartPole-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/) env -**
