# Deep Q Network
## What is DQN ?
* The DQN ([Deep Q-Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602)) algorithm was developed by DeepMind in 2015. 
* It was able to solve a wide range of Atari games (some to superhuman level) by combining reinforcement learning and deep neural networks at scale. 
* The algorithm was developed by enhancing a classic RL algorithm called Q-Learning with deep neural networks and a technique called experience replay.

## Implementing Deep Q-Learning in Python using PyTorch& OpenAI Gym
[CartPole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/) is one of the simplest environments in the OpenAI gym (a game simulator). As you can see in the above animation, the goal of CartPole is to balance a pole thatâ€™s connected with one joint on top of a moving cart.
