## Minimax Algorithm
A minimax algorithm is a recursive program written to find the best gameplay that minimizes any tendency to lose a game while maximizing any opportunity to win the game.
We can represent minimax as an exploration of a game tree's nodes to discover the best game move to make. In such a case, the tree's root is the game's current state, where the minimax algorithm got invoked.

The main aim of minimax algorithm is to find the best possible route amongst all possible routes to maximize rewards. 
Two major problems of minimax algorithm is that- 
1. It works only in episodic tasks i.e. a task which terminates after a finite number of steps.
2. Due to full sweep or deep search, it's time complexity is very high and its memory inefficient.
